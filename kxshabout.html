<h1> <font color="red"> ~ About Kxsh <br> and other projects ~ </h1>

<p> <font color="red"> Kxsh is just a nerdy guy with allot of time on his hands who's just getting back into coding <br> after a long break. Kxsh spends most of his time making websites like the one you see right here and also kik related shit such as mods, themes, bots, stanza, etc <br> the main reason for this website all together was just to bring together all the mods made on kik to one place <br> but shortly into writing allot more ideas were thought of such as adding side projects and abouts and updates <br> so thats why these new sub pages were added. </p>

<p> <font color="red"> Use Kxsh's DDoS Panel <br> Just please make sure you have a VPN enable while using it. </p>
